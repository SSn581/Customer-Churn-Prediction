# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. We will follow a typical machine learning project pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment.

# Data
It is provided with a dataset containing historical customer information, including customer attributes, interactions, and whether they churned or not. The dataset is in CSV format

# 1. Data Preprocessing:
* Load the provided dataset and perform initial data exploration.
* Handle missing data and outliers.
* Prepare the data for machine learning by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into training and testing sets.
# 2. Feature Engineering:
* Generate relevant features from the dataset that can help improve the model's prediction accuracy.
* Apply feature scaling or normalization if necessary.
# 3. Model Building:
* Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, or neural networks).
* Train and validate the selected model on the training dataset.
* Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
# 4. Model Optimization:
* Fine-tune the model parameters to improve its predictive performance.
* Explore techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
# 5. Model Deployment:
* Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it into a production-like environment (you can simulate this in a development environment).
* Ensure the model can take new customer data as input and provide churn predictions.
