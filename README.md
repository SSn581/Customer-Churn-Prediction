# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on historical customer data. We will follow a typical machine learning project pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment.

# Data
It is provided with a dataset containing historical customer information, including customer attributes, interactions, and whether they churned or not. The dataset is in CSV format

# Data Preprocessing:
* Load the provided dataset and perform initial data exploration.
* Handle missing data and outliers.
* Prepare the data for machine learning by encoding categorical variables and splitting it into training and testing sets.
